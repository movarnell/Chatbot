## What is this?

## Features

- **Senior Developer Bob**: Bob gives sage advice and has a wealth of experience to help you learn. He's a bit sarcastic and has a dry sense of humor. ðŸ¤“
- **Coding Kindergarten**: A friendly bot that helps you learn to code, while keeping the jargon to a minimum as well as the complexity. Always encouraging and supportive. ðŸ§¸
- **Wannabe Knowitall**: Reliable in providing the answer, but not much else. Snarky and known to be a bit of a know-it-all. ðŸ˜Ž


## Usage

Just type your message and hit enter. The chatbot will do the rest. It's like magic, but with more code. âœ¨
